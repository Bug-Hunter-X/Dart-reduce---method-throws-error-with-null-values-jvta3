# Dart Reduce() Method and Null Values

This example demonstrates an unexpected behavior of the `reduce()` method in Dart when dealing with lists containing null values. The `reduce()` method applies a function cumulatively to the elements of a list, but it doesn't handle null values gracefully.  If a null value is encountered, it throws a `NoSuchMethodError`. 

The solution involves adding null checks or using a different approach like `fold()` which provides better handling for nulls.
